Hi my name is Alexa Kelley. I am a security engineer with a diverse background. I have a particular focus in devops infrastructure and incident response. I am working on transitioning into leadership to better support my goals of diversity and ethics in tech. 

# Why did you make this site?
1. It is regularly expected for those looking to enter into the field of leadership to have a public presence. I have created this blog in part to help address that expectation.
2. I have thoughts on the tech industry that I would like to share that don't fit conveniently into the microblogging form factor.

# What is your professional philosophy? 
1. People > Technology/Tools. People deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.  Similarly just because something that a person does _can_ be replaced with technology does not always mean it _should_ be. 
2. We have a responsibility as an industry to engage with creating more effective regulation for corporations. This is both a personal and group responsibility. 
3. As engineers we have a direct responsibility for upholding ethical usage of technology, even in the face of pressure.
