Welcome! I am still developing this page, but I expect to be updating up to a few times a month. Check out my [about me](/about/) section if you want to know more about who I am. 

The majority of this site is in the [blog](/blog/) section where I'll be sharing my thoughts on security, diversity, and tech.
